# Linux-resource-monitoring
Bash script to help monitor my Raspberry Pi disk and RAM usage. <br>
First time writing bash script on my own without copying, and getopts is very handy for functional code. <br> <br>

## To use
Pull the repository to your computer. <br>
Open _terminal_ and type this (modify according to the path of your folder): <br>
`chmod +rx ${PATH}/usage.sh` <br> <br>

To get to help for commands.<br>
`{$PATH}/usage.sh -h`<br>
