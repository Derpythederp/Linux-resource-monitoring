# Linux-resource-monitoring
Bash script to help monitor my Raspberry Pi disk and RAM usage. 
First time writing bash script on my own without copying, and getopts is very handy for functional code.

## To use
Pull the repository to your computer.
Open _terminal_ and type this (modify according to the path of your folder):
`chmod +rx ${PATH}/usage.sh`

To get to help for commands.
`{$PATH}/usage.sh -h`
